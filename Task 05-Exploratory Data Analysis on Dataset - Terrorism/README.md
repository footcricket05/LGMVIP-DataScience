# Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism


## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset on terrorism and identify the hot zones of terrorism using exploratory data analysis techniques.

## Dataset 
Link- https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

## Approach:

1. Load the dataset using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy

2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps to remove any missing or irrelevant data

3. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data. This includes analyzing the frequency of terrorist attacks in different countries, regions, and over time.

4. Visualize the results using charts and graphs to gain insights and draw conclusions.

5. Use the findings to identify the hot zones of terrorism.


## Results:
The analysis of the dataset reveals that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa are the hot zones of terrorism. Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan are the countries that are most affected by terrorist attacks. The analysis also shows that the frequency of terrorist attacks has increased significantly over the past few decades.

## Conclusion:
Exploratory data analysis is an effective technique to gain insights into complex datasets. The analysis of the terrorism dataset reveals the hot zones of terrorism and provides useful insights to security and defense analysts. The findings can be used to develop strategies to counter terrorism and improve security measures in vulnerable areas.
